# Rune Breakers Roadmap
### Current version: v0.26 ~ initial public test
Outline of **major** features for upcoming versions. A version is considered completed when all major features are implemented. 

#### Disclaimer
Lists are non-comprehensive and will fall out of date from time to time. Entries will be added, reorganized, or deleted over time. This roadmap started as an internal organization list for myself, I'm sharing it publicly to give people an idea of what is upcoming, but these are not feature promises or guarantees in any way.

The next version has a detailed "todo list", while later versions have simple loose outlines of features.
